Examining Strategies For Winning Custom Blotto Game


Game is played between two players as follows:
1. Each player lays down 100 soldiers at castles marked 1-10, without knowing how many soldiers the other player lays down.
2. Starting with castle 1 and proceeding to castle 10, whoever has more soldiers at each castle wins the number of the castle. For example, if you win castle 2 20-15, you get 2 points. If it is a tie, neither team gets points.
3. Whoever gets to 20 points first wins, and the game is over.
